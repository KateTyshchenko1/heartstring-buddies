          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
            We created WhatAGirlWants.ai because we saw something missing in the AI companion space. While other companies treated female users as an afterthought, we started with a fundamental question: what do women actually want in an emotional connection?

            <p className="text-gray-600">
              We noticed that existing AI companions were largely designed by men, for menâ€”missing the nuanced emotional intelligence that women value in relationships. We knew we could do better. Our team combines expertise in psychology, technology, and personal growth to create companions that understand the complexity of women's emotional needs.

              <p>We believe everyone deserves to feel understood, especially during lonely moments or transitions. Whether you're healing from heartbreak, working on personal growth, or just need someone to talk to at 2 AM, your companion is thereâ€”without expectations or judgment.</p>
              <p>Think of it as a stepping stone, not a destination. If your companion helps you through a tough time, encourages your self-care journey, or simply makes you smile when you need it mostâ€”then deletes with you when you're ready to move onâ€”we've done our job.</p>
